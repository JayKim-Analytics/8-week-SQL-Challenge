### 1. How many pizzas were ordered?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(order_id) AS total_pizzas
FROM dbo.customer_orders
```

### Steps:
- Use **COUNT** to select the number of rows with an ```order_id``` value, which represents the total number of pizzas ordered.


<details>
	<summary> Answer </summary>

| total_pizzas |
| ------------ |
| 14           |
  
  - There are a total of 14 pizzas ordered.
  
</details>

### 2. How many unique customer orders were made?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS unique_orders
FROM dbo.customer_orders 
```

### Steps: 
- Use **COUNT** with **DISTINCT** over ```order_id``` to get the unique number of customer orders.


<details>
  <summary> Answer </summary>

| unique_orders |
| ------------- |
| 10            |
  
  - There are 10 unique customer orders.

### 3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?

```sql
SELECT runner_id, COUNT(order_id) AS sucessful_deliveries
FROM runner_orders
WHERE cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY runner_id
```

### Steps:
- Use **SELECT** to query each ```runner_id```and the **COUNT** of ```order_id``` for each runner.
- Use **WHERE** to filter the query and only return results where the order was not cancelled.
- Use **GROUP BY** to ```successful_deliveries``` for each runner.

<details>
  <summary> Answer </summary>
  
| runner_id | sucessful_deliveries |
| --------- | -------------------- |
| 1         | 4                    |
| 2         | 3                    |
| 3         | 1                    |
  
  - Runner 1 had 4 succesful deliveries.
  - Runner 2 had 3 succesful deliveries.
  - Runner 3 had 1 succesful deliveries.

### 4. How many of each type of pizza was delivered?

```sql
SELECT pn.pizza_name, COUNT(c.pizza_id) AS pizza_count
FROM customer_orders AS c
	INNER JOIN runner_orders AS ro
	ON c.order_id = ro.order_id
	INNER JOIN pizza_names AS pn
	ON c.pizza_id = pn.pizza_id
WHERE cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY pn.pizza_name;
```

### Steps:
- Use **JOIN** to merge the ```customer_orders``` table with ```runner_orders``` and ```pizza_names``` tables.
- Use **WHERE** to filter the query to only return results where the order was not cancelled.
- Use **GROUP BY** to group results by the type of pizza. 

<details>
	<summary> Answer </summary>
  
| pizza_name | pizza_count |
| ---------- | ----------- |

	ON c.order_id = ro.order_id
	INNER JOIN pizza_names AS pn
	ON c.pizza_id = pn.pizza_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, pn.pizza_name;
```

### Steps:
- Use **JOIN** to merge the ```customer_orders``` table with ```runner_orders``` and ```pizza_names``` tables.

```sql
SELECT TOP 1 COUNT(order_id) AS order_count
FROM customer_orders 
GROUP BY order_id
ORDER BY order_count DESC;
```

### Steps:
- Use **TOP 1 COUNT** to return only the top result of the query.
- Use **ORDER BY DESC** to order the query with the largest result at the top.

<details>
	<summary> Answer </summary>
	
| order_count | 
| ----------- | 
| 3           |

### 7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?

```sql
SELECT 
	c.customer_id,
	sum(CASE
		WHEN c.exclusions is not null 
			OR c.extras is not null
			THEN 1
		ELSE 0
	END) AS at_least_1_change,
	sum(CASE
		WHEN c.exclusions is null 
			AND c.extras is null
			THEN 1
		ELSE 0
	END) AS no_changes
FROM 
	customer_orders AS c,
	runner_orders AS r
WHERE
	c.order_id = r.order_id
	AND
	r.cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY c.customer_id

```

### Steps:
- Use **JOIN** to merge the ```customer_orders``` and ```runner_orders``` tables.
- Use **WHERE** to filter results to only included delivered pizzas.
- Use **CASE WHEN** within the **SELECT** statement to find permutations of results with at least 1 change, and no changes.

<details>
	<summary> Answer </summary>
	
| customer_id | at_least_1_change | no_changes |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| 101         | 0                 | 2          |
| 102         | 0                 | 3          |
| 103         | 3                 | 0          |
| 104         | 2                 | 1          |

	INNER JOIN runner_orders AS ro
	ON c.order_id = ro.order_id
WHERE cancellation IS NULL AND 
	(exclusions IS NOT NULL AND extras IS NOT NULL)

```

### Steps:
- Use **JOIN** to merge the ```customer_orders``` and ```runner_orders``` tables.
- Use **WHERE** to filter results where orders that were not cancelled, and had an exclusion and an extra.

SELECT DATEPART(HOUR, order_time) AS hour_of_day, COUNT(order_id) as order_count
	FROM customer_orders AS c
	GROUP BY DATEPART(HOUR, order_time)
```

### Steps:
- Use **DATEPART** to select the ```HOUR``` from ```order_time```.
- Use **GROUP BY** to match the ```HOUR``` with the **COUNT** of ```order_id```. 

<details>
	<summary> Answer </summary>
	
| hour_of_day | order_count |

  COUNT(order_id) AS total_pizzas_ordered
FROM customer_orders
GROUP BY FORMAT(DATEADD(DAY, 2, order_time),'dddd');
