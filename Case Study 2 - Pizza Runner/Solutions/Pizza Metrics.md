```sql
SELECT runner_id, COUNT(order_id) AS sucessful_deliveries
FROM runner_orders
WHERE cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY runner_id
```

- Use **SELECT** to query each ```runner_id```and the **COUNT** of ```order_id``` for each runner.
- Use **WHERE** to filter the query and only return results where the order was not cancelled.
- Use **GROUP BY** to ```successful_deliveries``` for each runner.

<details>
  <summary> Answer </summary>
  
| runner_id | sucessful_deliveries |
| --------- | -------------------- |
| 1         | 4                    |
| 2         | 3                    |
| 3         | 1                    |

### 4. How many of each type of pizza was delivered?

```sql
SELECT pn.pizza_name, COUNT(c.pizza_id) AS pizza_count
FROM customer_orders AS c
	INNER JOIN runner_orders AS ro
	ON c.order_id = ro.order_id
	INNER JOIN pizza_names AS pn
	ON c.pizza_id = pn.pizza_id
WHERE cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY pn.pizza_name;
```

### Steps:
- Use **JOIN** to merge the ```customer_orders``` table with ```runner_orders``` and ```pizza_names``` tables.
- Use **WHERE** to filter the query to only return results where the order was not cancelled.
- Use **GROUP BY** to group results by the type of pizza. 

<details>
	<summary> Answer </summary>
  
| pizza_name | pizza_count |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Meatlovers | 9           |

FROM customer_orders AS c
	INNER JOIN runner_orders AS ro
	ON c.order_id = ro.order_id
	INNER JOIN pizza_names AS pn
	ON c.pizza_id = pn.pizza_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, pn.pizza_name;
```

### Steps:
- Use **JOIN** to merge the ```customer_orders``` table with ```runner_orders``` and ```pizza_names``` tables.
- Use **GROUP BY** to group results by ```customer_id``` and ```pizza_name```.
